        Directions
        <li>
            Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucespan over medium heat.
            Add garlic and giner; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
            Stir in brown sugar, soy sauce, and water. Increase heat to medium-high;
            stir untill sauce boils and slightly thickens, about 4 minutes. 
            Remove sauce from the heat and set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place beef into a large bow;; add cornstarch and mix until beef is thoroughly
            coated. Set aside until most of the cornstarch has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)</li>
        <li>
            Shake excess cornstarch from beef slices and drop into hot oil, a few at a time
            stirring briefly and frying until edges become crisp, about 2 minutes.
            Remove beef with a large slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove excess oil from skillet, then heat the skillet over medium heat;
            add beef slices and stir in prepared sauce. Add green onions and bring 
            a boil; cook until the onions have just softened and are bright green,
            about 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
